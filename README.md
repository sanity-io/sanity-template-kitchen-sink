# sanity-template-kitchen-sink

_Fully customizable examples of page building, blog template and more examples
with a React.js front-end._

This template repo is used by Sanity.io to easily create deployed and
configured projects through a web interface. You can test it by [creating this
project](https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io%2Fsanity-template-kitchen-sink).

The template contains both a Sanity.io Sanity Studio and a front-end in Gatsby.
Both are deployed on Netlify.

Want to make a template for Sanity and your favourite front-end framework?
We’re still maturing [sanity.io/create](https://sanity.io/create) and our APIs,
but do tell us about it on [slack.sanity.io](https://slack.sanity.io).

## Local development

You develop the templates in `/template`, and review your changes in `/build`.

1. **Install dependencies with `npm install` in the root folder.** This will
   install the template development tool that watches changes in the
   `/template` folder and output the template to `/build`.

2. **Run `npm run dev` in root folder.** This will build the template files to
   `/build`. This is how the code will look for those who install the project
   later.

3. **Run `npm install` in `./build/web` and `sanity install` in
   `/build/studio`** This will install the necessary dependencies for the
   Gatsby frontend and the Studio.

4. **Run `npm run dev` in `./build/web` and `sanity start` in
   `/build/studio`**. This will start the development servers for the Gatsby
   frontend and Sanity Studio.

## Notes

When developing ProjectId and dataset name can be changed in `template-values-development.json`
